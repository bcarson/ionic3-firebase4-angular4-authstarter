     different forms depending on the provider. We also can fill in the blanks for any missing data, making the
     currentUserInfo object suitable for cross page data sharing and firebase user data for database store.

     notes on twitter avatars:
     If a user changes their profile settings, such as avatar, firebase has previously cached the twitter user details.
     This will expire at some point ??- I deleted the user in the Firebase dashboard and re-logged in, at which point
     all the profile changes are propagated. This likely applies to Facebook & Google methods as well.

     Pull the user email. This can come from 2 sources (userInfo.email or userInfo.providerData[0].email)
     depending on the auth provider. Specifically, for google auth, the email field in userInfo.email is blank on successful login,
     instead use the providerData array for google email.
